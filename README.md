# ATLIQ TECHNOLOGIES - SQL PROJECT

## Company Overview

**AtliQ Technologies**  
AtliQ Technologies is a leading computer devices manufacturer based in India, catering to 74 prominent customers, including Amazon and Croma. The company operates across 27 global markets, such as India, South Korea, and Italy, spanning 4 major regions. With a diverse product portfolio of 73 products and 26 variants (e.g., Plus, Standard), AtliQ specializes in 6 key segments, including peripherals, accessories, networking, and storage solutions.

## Problem Statement

AtliQ Technologies, a global computer devices manufacturer, faced challenges in gaining actionable insights from its large-scale sales data spread across 74 customers and 27 markets. The company needed to optimize its sales strategies by identifying key revenue drivers such as top-performing products, markets, and customers.

Additionally, AtliQ required detailed reports on sales performance across fiscal years, market share, and regional trends to enhance decision-making. However, the lack of fiscal year data and limited visibility into pre- and post-invoice sales deductions complicated their financial analysis and reporting.

To address these challenges, I utilized SQL to generate calculated columns, reports, stored procedures, and views that streamlined data processing and provided clarity on key performance indicators such as gross sales, net sales, and market share across regions.
